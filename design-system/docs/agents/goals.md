# Design Goals and Philosophy

Create a familiar yet refined desktop environment for technical users transitioning between Windows 11 and macOS.

Target audience:

- Developers, power users, system administrators
- Comfortable with Windows 11 patterns
- Appreciate macOS polish and attention to detail
- Value efficiency and customization

Design philosophy:

- Familiar foundation: Windows 11 layout, window controls, system tray
- macOS refinement: subtle animations, typography, thoughtful spacing
- Technical transparency: surface system info, expose power-user controls
- Consistent theming: Zenwritten Dark across components

Visual language:

- Clean, modern interfaces with purposeful space
- Subtle depth through layered backgrounds
- Accent colors used sparingly for interaction states
- Typography balances readability with information density
- Smooth, non-distracting transitions
