name: wt-switch-create
description: Create a new worktrunk worktree (optionally in another repo) and switch this session's working directory into it. Use when launching a session that should work in its own worktree.
argument-hint: "[<branch>] [<repo>] [-- <task>]"
license: MIT OR Apache-2.0
compatibility: Requires the `wt` CLI (https://worktrunk.dev)
---

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`. Grammar: `[<branch>] [<repo>] [-- <task>]`.

- **branch** — optional; the branch name for the new worktree. When omitted,
  pick one (step 1 below).
- **repo** — optional path; create the worktree in this repo instead of the
  session's current one.
- **task** — optional; what to do inside the new worktree. No task means enter
  the worktree and wait.

Tokens before the `--` are the branch and/or repo: a path-shaped token
(starting with `/`, `~`, `./`, or `../`) is the repo; any other token is the
branch (`docs` is a branch name, never the `docs/` directory). More than one
branch-shaped token before a `--` doesn't fit the grammar — ask. Without a
`--`, judge where the task starts: leading tokens that read as a branch name
(`fix-auth`) or a repo path are consumed as such, and the rest is the task;
otherwise the whole input is the task (`fix the parser bug` has no
branch-shaped lead — all task).

```
/wt-switch-create my-feature -- fix the parser bug
/wt-switch-create -- fix the parser bug
/wt-switch-create my-feature ~/workspace/other-repo -- fix the parser bug
/wt-switch-create my-feature
```

## What to do

Steps 1–3 run on every invocation, before any other work. The invocation is
itself the explicit request to create the worktree; a research or read-only
task gets one all the same.

<!-- Maintainers: rationale.md (same directory) covers the harness rules and
design choices behind this — read it before re-adding guards or routes. -->

1. **Pick the branch name** if none was given: short, from the task and
   consistent with existing worktree names, or, mid-session, from the work
   being moved; with nothing to derive from, ask.

2. **Create the worktree** with a `Bash` call (omit `-C <repo>` for this repo):

   ```
   wt -C <repo> switch --create <branch> --no-cd --format=json
   ```

   Stdout is JSON whose `path` field is the worktree's absolute path (status
   lines go to stderr). On `Branch <branch> already exists`: if the user named
   the branch, rerun without `--create` (it enters the branch, creating its
   worktree if missing); if step 1 picked the name, pick another and rerun. Any
   other failure (not a git repo, invalid name): report it and stop.

   Mid-session, carry uncommitted work across: `git stash push -u` before
   creating the worktree, then `git -C <path> stash pop` after (the stash is
   shared across worktrees).

3. **Enter the worktree, then do the task.** Call
   `EnterWorktree({path: "<path from the JSON>"})`.

   - **Accepted** → the session is re-rooted in the worktree. Do the task (or,
     with no task text, confirm it's ready and wait).
   - **Rejected** → graceful, and nothing is created. `EnterWorktree`
     re-roots only into a worktree the session is permitted to enter, and that
     permitted set is fixed by two factors: the repo your cwd resolves to, and
     the session's state. Each rejection is just that set coming up empty or
     without the target: no repo resolves (cwd is outside any git repo, e.g. a
     non-git parent such as `~/workspace` that only holds repos, as in a
     background job), which fails with `the current directory is not in a git
     repository`; the target belongs to a different repo than the one resolved;
     or the session is already rooted in a worktree (or is a pinned agent), a
     state that narrows the set to the resolved repo's `.claude/worktrees/` and
     so excludes even a same-repo `wt` sibling. All reduce to the same recovery
     test: whether you can `cd` into the worktree, which works when it's inside
     an allowed directory (a `permissions.additionalDirectories` entry such as
     `~/workspace`). So `cd <path>` and read the result:
     - no `Shell cwd was reset` notice → it stuck; the worktree is reachable.
       Work there, but a bare `cd` is not a tracked re-root, so the cwd can
       revert to the session's launch worktree across turns (and in spawned
       subagents); pin commands with `git -C <path>` / `wt -C <path>` rather
       than trusting the `cd` to persist.
     - `Shell cwd was reset` → not reachable. Stop and ask the user to make it
       reachable: add the repo, or a parent like `~/workspace`, to
       `permissions.additionalDirectories` (durable, every session), or run
       `/add-dir <path>` (this session). Then continue. Don't grind through
       absolute paths with `cd` resetting on every command.

## Cleanup

The worktree is a normal worktrunk worktree: it persists after the session
ends, shows up in `wt list`, and is merged or removed with `wt merge` /
`wt remove <branch>` like any other. Don't remove it unprompted. If the user
asks to leave mid-session, `ExitWorktree({action: "keep"})` returns the
session to its original directory; `ExitWorktree` cannot remove a worktree
entered by `path`, so removal is always `wt remove <branch>`.

## Scope

The command's mandate is ONE worktree (in the named repo, if one was given)
and the requested task inside it. Commits, pushes, and merges still each
require explicit user permission.
