# README Style Guide

## Common Mistakes

- **No install steps** - Never assume setup is obvious
- **No examples** - Show, don't just tell
- **Wall of text** - Use headers, tables, lists
- **Stale content** - Add "last reviewed" date
- **Generic tone** - Write for YOUR audience
- **Emoji overload** - Avoid excessive emojis; they clutter and date quickly

## Emoji Usage

**Default: Don't use emojis** unless the user explicitly requests them or the project context clearly calls for it (e.g., a fun personal project where the author's style is playful).

Reasons to avoid:
- **Professionalism** - Most projects benefit from straightforward, professional tone
- **Accessibility** - Screen readers struggle with emojis
- **Maintenance** - Emojis date quickly and feel trendy rather than timeless
- **Clarity** - Clear headers and structure work better than visual decoration

If emojis are requested:
- Use sparingly (1-2 per major section at most)
- Ensure they add meaning, not just decoration
- Never use in badges, code blocks, or technical instructions
- Avoid in professional/internal/OSS projects unless explicitly desired

## Prose Quality

For general writing advice — clear prose, Strunk's rules, and AI patterns to avoid — use the `writing-clearly-and-concisely` skill.
