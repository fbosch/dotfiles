# Platform Notes

- Check platform: `require("utils.platform")` in Lua, `switch (uname)` in Fish
- macOS (Darwin): Homebrew from `/opt/homebrew` or `/usr/local`
- Linux: Homebrew from `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew` or native package managers
- Cursor/VSCode: Fish auto-switches to dash (see `.config/fish/config.fish:1-4`)
