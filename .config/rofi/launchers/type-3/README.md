Type 3 launcher theme for Rofi imported from https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi.

Included files:
- launcher.sh
- style-1.rasi through style-10.rasi
- shared/colors.rasi and shared/fonts.rasi
- LICENSE (GPLv3)

Colors default to ~/.config/rofi/colors/onedark.rasi, which is provided in this repo. Adjust shared/colors.rasi if you prefer another palette. launcher.sh selects `style-3` (variant 3); change `theme` in that script to try others.

Launch with:
  ~/.config/rofi/launchers/type-3/launcher.sh
