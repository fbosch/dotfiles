# Extension Icon

This directory should contain an `extension_icon.png` file.

For now, you can:
1. Create your own icon (recommended size: 512x512 or 1024x1024 PNG)
2. Use an emoji as a temporary placeholder
3. Copy an icon from another extension

Suggested icons:
- A folder with a star/heart
- A bookmark icon
- A directory tree icon

You can generate one using your preferred image editing tool or download from icon sets like:
- Lucide Icons (https://lucide.dev)
- Heroicons (https://heroicons.com)
- Material Icons (https://fonts.google.com/icons)
