# Network and Privacy

While Vicinae operates fully offline for most features, it includes optional web integrations to enhance functionality. This page details all network activity and privacy considerations.

## Network Activity

Vicinae makes network requests in these specific scenarios:

- **Favicon loading** - When [favicon loading](/favicon) is enabled (the default), built-in commands fetch favicons for HTTP URLs to use as icons
- **Exchange rates** - The calculator may need to fetch exchange rates in order to provide accurate currency conversions. How it's done depends on the [configured backend](/calculator#supported-backends)
- **Typescript extensions** - typescript extensions can make arbitrary network requests. More details about extensions below.
- **Raycast compatibility** - The Raycast compatibility extension allows to browse the official Raycast store and install extensions published to it.

## Typescript Extensions

Extensions built with the [React/TypeScript SDK](/extensions/introduction) currently run without sandboxing or permission restrictions. 
They are granted the same level of privilege as the user the Vicinae server is running under.

- Typescript extensions are completely optional—none are installed by default
- Extension runtime support can be disabled entirely at build time
- All extensions require explicit user installation

<Note>
We may introduce sandboxing capabilities in the future.

## Data Collection 

### Vicinae Application

The Vicinae application collects no telemetry, analytics, or usage data of any kind.

### Documentation Website

This documentation website uses [@vercel/analytics](https://github.com/vercel/analytics#readme) to track page views. 

Vercel Analytics is privacy-focused, collecting minimal data without attempting to bypass ad blockers. 

We use this data solely to understand which documentation sections are most valuable to users and improve content accordingly.
