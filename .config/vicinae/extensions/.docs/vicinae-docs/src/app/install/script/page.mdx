# Script Installation

Vicinae can be installed using an automated installation script that provides a hassle-free setup experience with minimal configuration required.

<Note>
If Vicinae is already packaged by your distribution, you should install it through your package manager instead for better system integration and automatic updates.

## Quick Install

Run the following command to install Vicinae:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vicinae.com/install.sh | bash
```

<Warning>
The above command will prompt you to enter your sudo password, as elevated privileges are required to install Vicinae under `/usr/local`, which is the default installation prefix.
Note that it is possible to install Vicinae without root access, although it requires more setup. More on that below.
</Warning>

The installation script will automatically:

- Download the latest AppImage from GitHub releases
- Extract Vicinae and all its runtime dependencies to `/usr/local/lib/vicinae`
- Create symbolic links for binaries in your PATH
- Install desktop files, icons, and default themes
- Set up `vicinae-node` for seamless TypeScript extension support. This is a regular Node.js binary included to run extensions.

After installation completes, verify it was successful:

```
$> vicinae version
Version v0.16.2 (commit b99015bc2)
Build: GCC 15.2.0 - Release - LTO
Provenance: appimage
```

## Update

To update Vicinae, run the installation script again. It will detect your existing installation (if using the same prefix) and update it.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vicinae.com/install.sh | bash
```

## Uninstall

To uninstall Vicinae, run the installation script with the `--uninstall` argument:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vicinae.com/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
```

## Install with custom prefix

By default, the script tries to install Vicinae under `/usr/local`, but for users with specific constraints (e.g., no root access), this might not be desirable.

To accommodate these users, the script provides a `--prefix` option:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vicinae.com/install.sh | bash -s -- --prefix ~/.local
```

### Custom prefix caveats

In order to have a fully working installation of Vicinae, you need to make sure that:

- The Vicinae server knows where to find the `vicinae-node` binary. If you set your PATH in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, the Vicinae server might not have the correct PATH set, as it might be started before those files are sourced.
- The Vicinae desktop file that declares the `x-scheme-handler/vicinae` and `x-scheme-handler/raycast` MIME type associations should be searchable by the standard XDG tooling. You can verify this is working by opening any Vicinae deeplink, e.g., `xdg-open vicinae://toggle`.
If this is not working, some features such as the OAuth extension flow will not work.
