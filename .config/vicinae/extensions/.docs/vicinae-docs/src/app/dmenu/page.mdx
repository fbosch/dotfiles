# dmenu Mode

Vicinae supports a special "dmenu" mode that can be used to generate a list view from a newline-delimited list of entries passed through standard input. It is named in reference to the popular `dmenu` unix program.

This is useful in order to quickly create simpler menus. If you are looking to build more complex menus, you should look into making your own [extension](/extensions/introduction).

## Usage

To use dmenu mode, you need to use the `vicinae dmenu` subcommand:

<CodeGroup title="Generate a list of options">
```bash {{ title: 'piped' }}
echo -e 'option 1\noption 2\noption 3\n' | vicinae dmenu --placeholder "Select option"
```

```bash {{ title: 'from file' }}
vicinae dmenu --placeholder "Select option" < options.txt
```

```bash {{ title: 'from stdin' }}
$> vicinae dmenu --placeholder "Select option"
option 1
option 2
option 3
<C-d>
```
</CodeGroup>

You can get a full list of available options with `vicinae dmenu --help`.

## Quick look

Since version **0.16.3**, dmenu mode supports a quick look feature when absolute file paths are used as inputs.

This enables quick file searches or even simple wallpaper pickers. 

```bash
# a simple wallpaper picker
swww img $(find ~/Pictures/walls -type f | vicinae dmenu -p 'Pick a wallpaper...')

# a quick way to browse some files (10,000+ files can become a bit laggy)
xdg-open $(find ~/Desktop/invoices -name '*.pdf' | vicinae dmenu -p 'Select invoice...')
```

<Note>
If quick look is not desired, it is possible to fully turn it off by passing the `--no-quick-look` flag.
