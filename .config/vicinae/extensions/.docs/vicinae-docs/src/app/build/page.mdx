# Build from source

This guide will teach you how to install Vicinae from source and build an optimized version of the binary. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Why build from source 

Vicinae is a decently sized mostly C++ code base. As such, compiling it can be quite resource demanding and time consuming, in particular if you enable specific optimizations such as LTO.

The main reward for compiling it yourself is the ability to compile Vicinae with [optimizations that are specific to your CPU model](/build#optimized-build), provided that it's recent enough. And also, it's fun 😏.

If your goal is to get Vicinae up and running on your system as quickly as possible please consider [installing from a repository](/repo-install) if your distribution is supported or [installing from the latest release](/release-install) if that is not the case.

## Build requirements

To build Vicinae, you need a working C++23-capable compiler. We mostly make use of `gcc` (v15+) but `clang` should also work and will be the officially supported way to build for MacOS in the future.

You will also need a few dependencies, listed below.

If you distribution does not appear in this list, you are on your own to figure out the exact packages to install. 
If you still manage to build it, don't forget to contribute to this documentation by adding your list here!

## Recommended build tools

In order to make building and rebuilding Vicinae easier we recommend installing the following:

- Install `ccache` to automatically cache most compilations and significantly decrease build times.
- Install the `mold` linker to link the Vicinae binary significantly faster.

All you need is to install these tools, the Vicinae build system will take care of the rest for you.

## Build Flags

Several build flags are available to tweak what features are built into the final binary.
The best way to know about them is to read the beginning of the top level `CMakeLists.txt`.

Flags are easily identified by the use of the `option` cmake function:

```cmake
option(LTO "Enable Link Time Optimization (LTO). This will result in better performance, but greatly increased compile time." OFF)
option(NOSTRIP "Never strip debug symbols from the binary, even in release mode. Note that symbols are never stripped for debug releases." OFF)
option(USE_SYSTEM_PROTOBUF "Use system protobuf instead of building it from source" ON)
option(USE_SYSTEM_ABSEIL "Use system abseil (libabsl) instead of building it from source" ON)
option(USE_SYSTEM_CMARK_GFM "Use system cmark-gfm (github's fork of cmark) instead of building it from source" ON)
```

You can enable or disable a given option by passing a `-D<OPTION>=ON/OFF` flag to the `cmake` program during the *configuration* step. See the CMake code examples below.

## About static linking

Although Vicinae does not support being built in a fully static way, we provide the option to statically link against libraries that bump version often
or are generally not easy to install through traditional means.

The main goal of this is to make pre-built binaries more portable across different distributions that ship different versions of the same package.

For instance, `libprotobuf` updates very often and offers no retro-compatibility. This essentially means that the distributed binaries become outdated as soon as the distribution updates
its protobuf version. By statically linking against protobuf, we embed a given version of protobuf in the binary, and this specific, local version is the one going to be used for the entire lifetime of the binary.

<Warning>
If building from source you have very few reasons to statically link against libraries. This is mostly intended to help people packaging Vicinae as a standalone binary.
</Warning>

For reference, this is the CMake configure command we use to build our releases:

```bash
cmake -G Ninja .. \
	-DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5  \
	-DLTO=ON \
	-DUSE_SYSTEM_PROTOBUF=OFF \
	-DUSE_SYSTEM_ABSEIL=OFF \
	-DUSE_SYSTEM_CMARK_GFM=OFF \
```

This will:
	- instruct `cmake` to download a copy of a specific version of `protobuf`, `abseil`, `cmark-gfm` and `minizip-ng`
	- build them alongside the main Vicinae code base
	- link them all together as a single binary

<Note>
We may add static linking options for other libraries down the road.
</Note>


## Get the source code

First, clone the repository and go to the source directory:

```bash {{ title: 'Clone repo' }}
git clone https://github.com/vicinaehq/vicinae.git && cd vicinae
```

## Release Build

<Warning>
This is a generic, unoptimized build. If you are looking to build an optimized version for your specific system, read further.
</Warning>

To build a generic release build without LTO enabled:

<CodeGroup>
```bash {{ title: 'Make' }}
make release
```

```bash {{ title: 'CMake' }}
cmake -G Ninja -B build
cmake --build build 
```
</CodeGroup>

## Optimized Release Build

If you want to squeeze out the most performance you can out of Vicinae, you can enable a few optimization during configuration:

<CodeGroup>
```bash {{ title: 'Make' }}
make host-optimized
```

```bash {{ title: 'CMake' }}
CXXFLAGS="${CXXFLAGS} -march=native" cmake -DLTO=ON -G Ninja -B build
cmake --build build 
```
</CodeGroup>

- `-DLTO=ON` will enable link-time optimizations. This can greatly improve performance, but linkage will take a **lot** more time.
- `-march=native` compiles with all optimizations supported by the executing CPU. The resulting binary will only be able to be run on systems that support the same CPU flags.

Generally speaking, you will be trading compilation time and portability for more performance.

<Note>
Binary releases are always compiled with link-time optimizations.
</Note>

## Debug Build

You want a debug build when you are trying to troubleshoot an issue or generally contribute to Vicinae:

<CodeGroup>
```bash {{ title: 'Make' }}
make debug
```

```bash {{ title: 'CMake' }}
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G Ninja -B build
cmake --build build 
```
</CodeGroup>

This will compile with `-g3`, enable sanitizers (asan + ubsan) and QT debug logs.

## Install built binaries

Once Vicinae is built, install it to standard system directories:

<CodeGroup>
```bash {{ title: 'Make' }}
sudo make install
```

```bash {{ title: 'CMake' }}
sudo cmake --install build --prefix "$HOME/.local" 
```
</CodeGroup>
