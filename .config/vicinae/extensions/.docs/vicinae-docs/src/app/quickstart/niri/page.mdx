# Niri Quickstart

This guide shows the best way to quickly get started with Vicinae on [Niri](https://yalter.github.io/niri).

## Main configuration

Add the following to your Niri configuration, and you are good to go.

```ini
# ~/.config/niri/config.kdl
spawn-sh-at-startup "vicinae server"

# use whatever shortcut floats your boat
Mod+Space repeat=false { spawn "vicinae" "toggle"; }
```

<Note>
  On first startup, Vicinae will use a lot of CPU in order to populate the file
  index.
</Note>

## Bind to a custom command

You can easily create a binding to open any vicinae command directly:

```ini
# ~/.config/niri/config.kdl

Mod+P repeat=false { spawn "vicinae" "vicinae://extensions/vicinae/clipboard/history"; }
```

You can do a lot with this: [learn more about deeplinks](/deeplinks).

## Blur

Niri [doesn't currently support blur](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/issues/54). 

A [patch](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/pull/1634) is available, but it remains buggy and doesn't seem to work with layer surfaces.

## Focus window on activation
You may want to focus an application window after vicinae triggers an action related to it.

*For example : using a shortcut action in vicnae that opens a browser tab → Instantly focus the window where the action happened*

You can have this behavior by adding this to your config:

```ini
# ~/.config/niri/config.kdl

debug {

honor-xdg-activation-with-invalid-serial

}
```
