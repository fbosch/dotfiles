# Emoji Picker

Vicinae ships with a capable emoji picker out of the box.

## Use emoji picker

Simply launch the [Search Emojis and Symbols](vicinae://extensions/vicinae/core/search-emojis) command.

From there you can copy, pin or add custom keywords to index a specific emoji.

## Emoji font selection

Currently, Vicinae uses a somewhat hacky method in order to figure out what emoji font should be used.

If Vicinae doesn't pick up the emoji font you would like it to, it is possible to override it by setting the `EMOJI_FONT` environment variable to the font family of your choice.

For instance:

```bash
EMOJI_FONT=Twemoji vicinae server
```

<Note>
If the family doesn't exist, a warning will be printed out and the regular emoji font selection logic will apply.
