Vicinae script commands are mostly compatible with [Raycast script commands](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands). In most cases, you should be able to take any Raycast script command and use it with vicinae, provided that the script logic itself remains valid in your environment.

This means you can use `@raycast` instead of `@vicinae` for all directives that are supported by both systems. For directives that have been added by vicinae, only `@vicinae` is supported to avoid confusion.

Vicinae adds support for new directives such as `@vicinae.keywords` and `@vicinae.exec` and new output modes such as `terminal`.

Vicinae doesn't support arguments of type `dropdown` at this time, but this will likely change in the future.
