Output modes control how script results are displayed in Vicinae. Choose the mode that best fits your script's purpose and output type.

# Output Modes

## Full output

The output of the script is displayed in a new view. Text can be selected and copied from there.

This mode supports basic ANSI color codes. This means you can use basic colors in your output and have them render properly. This is, for now, exclusive to this output mode.

## Terminal

The script is executed in a new terminal window. If the [default terminal](/default-terminal) supports it, `--hold` or an equivalent flag is passed to keep the terminal window open even when the script is done executing.
