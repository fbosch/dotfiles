# Extension Icon TODO

This extension needs an `extension_icon.png` file in this directory.

You can:
1. Copy an icon from another extension as a placeholder
2. Create a custom icon (recommended size: 512x512px)
3. Use an image representing wallpapers/desktop backgrounds

Example command to copy from another extension:
```bash
cp ../wallhaven-search/assets/extension_icon.png ./extension_icon.png
```
