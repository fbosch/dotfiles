# AGENTS

Configuration for Glance dashboard pages, widgets, and assets.

## Essentials

- Keep page layout in `pages/` and reusable widget definitions in `widgets/`.
- Keep shared styling/assets in `assets/` and global wiring in `glance.yml`.
- Keep secrets out of committed YAML; use runtime environment variables.
- Prefer local files and scripts in this directory over external docs.
