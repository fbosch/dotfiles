## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0]

### Changed 

- Bumped `@opencode-ai/plugin` and `@opencode-ai/sdk` to 1.2.15

## [0.4.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed race condition where handoff prompt text was silently dropped because `appendPrompt` fired before the TUI finished navigating to the new session ([#16](https://github.com/joshuadavidthomas/opencode-handoff/issues/16))

## [0.4.0]

### Changed

- Simplified handoff session creation by removing textarea resize workaround (see [sst/opencode#5983](https://github.com/sst/opencode/pull/5983))
- Updated minimum OpenCode version requirement to 1.0.188

## [0.3.2]

### Changed

- File injection now uses synthetic text parts instead of file parts
- Extracted OpenCode-compatible code (binary detection, file formatting) to `vendor.ts` for maintainability
- Clarified user input section of handoff prompt to treat input as direction, not investigation triggers

### Fixed

- Session title generation now works correctly in handoff sessions

## [0.3.1]

### Fixed

- Added missing `clearPrompt` call to prevent double handoff prompt in new session

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- Automatic file injection: @file references in handoff prompts are now automatically loaded into the new session's context

### Changed

- `handoff_session` now accepts `files` array argument
- Restructured `/handoff` command prompt with XML sections (`<context>`, `<instructions>`, `<user_input>`)

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- `read_session` tool for reading conversation transcripts from previous sessions
- Handoff prompts now automatically include a reference to the source session, enabling cross-session context retrieval

### Changed

- Renamed `handoff_prepare` tool to `handoff_session`

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- `/handoff <goal>` command for creating focused continuation prompts
- `handoff_session` tool for session creation with draft prompt
